<b>DOOM FOR SYMBOS</b><br>
<br>
Welcome to <b>DOOM for SymbOS</b>, a Doom-like implementation for all SymbOS platforms.<br>
<br>
DOOM is based on <b>zDoom</b> for the <b>TI83/TI84 calculator</b> series. This fantastic project has been developed by Alexis Guinamard, Guillaume Hoffmann and Raphael Siryani back in the 2000ies.<br>
<br>
14 years later NYYRIKKI, well known for his very special crazy projects, ported it to the MSX in 09/2021 and then even to SymbOS a few days later.<br>
<br>
This brought Prodatron back to the Z80 after beeing lazy for years, and so he decided to continue the development of this port.<br>
<br>
Please note, that Doom isn't the fastest on a standard CPC or MSX1/2. The Raycasting routines take a lot of CPU time, and there seems to be some overhead in the display routines as well. So there is the big question, how much still can be optimized. For more fun play it in an emulator with increased CPU power or enjoy it on a real MSX TurboR, OCM or accelerated Enterprise 64/128.<br>

<h1>2000-Using Doom</h2>

<h2>2100-Screen Layout</h2>
<br>
<b>SCREEN LAYOUT</b><br>
<br>
Doom is a first-person shooter and so it is centered on weapon-based combat in a first-person perspective. You will experience the action through the eyes of your hero and control him in a three-dimensional space.<br>
<br>
The upper part of the screen shows the 3D world, were you are walking and fighting. On the lower side you will see the amount of ammunition for your selected weapon, your health status and how it will be, if you look into the mirror and see your ugly face.<br>
<br>
